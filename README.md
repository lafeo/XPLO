# XPLO The tech club of Jamnabai Narsee School. 

# Upload potential ideas, explore other's work. Get inspired, create, and progress.

This is the Official GitHub repository for the club. XPLO is a tech club at Jamnabai Narsee School, which focuses on empowering a builder space oriented approach. That is where every person/maker/builder will have indivisual freedom which is rare to find in institution at the school level. Jamnabai Narsee School is a school which focuses on overall growth of students and encourages them to find the right balance. Here at XPLO we try and combine different feilds and converge them into a path which will not only make students learn, understand, but also create and explore their ideas. 
# This is a club, and not an average classroom. So apart from guiding and providing basic knowledge and information about programming, modelling, circuitry they are allowed to ideate and create what their vision and thoughts say.
